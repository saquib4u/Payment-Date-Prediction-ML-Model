# Payment-Date-Prediction-ML-Model
Machine Learning Model to predict payment date for the invoices using XGBoost Regressor.

It is a Machine Learning Model in which users in the Account Receivable
departments do the following tasks on a daily basis:

● View data from various purchasers' invoices.

● View the invoice(s) from a certain buyer's various fields/attributes.

● Pre-process the invoice data via data pre-processing.

● With EDA and Feature Engineering, we may get account-level analytics to quickly
display and comprehend data.

● Get an estimate for when the invoice will be paid


I have compared the various machine learning models to determine which one best suits the
needs:

On the basis of the algorithm, MSE score, and R2 score, the models I have taken under
comparison are:

1. Linear Regression

2. Decision Tree Regression

3. Random Forest Regression

4. Support Vector Regression

5. Extreme Gradient Boost Regression
